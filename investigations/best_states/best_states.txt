I'm defining the best states as those with the highest proportion of 9's and 10's in overall quality among hospitals in that state. Again, I'm choosing an overall measure of wuality, as opposed to the individual questions as I believe this more accurately reflects the state of care as a whole in a state. As is often the case in market research, I am considering only 9's and 10's as high ratings, since research shows that anything below a 9, tends to mean average satisfaction at best.
